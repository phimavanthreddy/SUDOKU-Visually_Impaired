# Sudoku Game for the Visually Impaired

Welcome to the Sudoku Game project! This project aims to create an interactive Sudoku game designed specifically for individuals with visual impairments, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## About

Sudoku is a popular puzzle game that involves filling a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. This project provides a web-based implementation of Sudoku where users can play the game directly in their web browser, with features tailored to accommodate the needs of visually impaired individuals.

## Features

- Dynamic generation of Sudoku grids with random initial values.
- User input validation to ensure the correctness of the solution.
- Auditory feedback when hovered over the digits, speaks the digit values.
- Auditory feedback for correct and incorrect inputs.
- Vibration feedback when hovering over border cells to alert the user of going out of bounds.
- Option to start a new game to refresh the grid.

## Getting Started

## Usage

- To input a number into a cell, click on the desired cell and type the number using your keyboard.
- If the number is valid according to Sudoku rules, it will be accepted and displayed in the cell.
